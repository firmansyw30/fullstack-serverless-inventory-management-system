# CDN cache mode - how aggressively to cache content
# Options:

#   - INVALIDATE_ON_CHANGES: Cache until content changes
#   - USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS: Use cache headers from origin

# Client-side cache TTL (Time To Live) in seconds
# How long browsers will cache content

# ============================================================
# API GATEWAY CONFIGURATION
# ============================================================
# API ID for the API Gateway
# Must be unique within your project
# Format: lowercase, alphanumeric, hyphens allowed
api_id = "inventory-api"

# API Config ID for version control
# Useful when deploying multiple versions of your API

# ============================================================
# NOTES & BEST PRACTICES
# ============================================================
#
# 1. NAMING CONVENTIONS:
#    - Cloud Storage bucket names must be globally unique
#    - Use lowercase and hyphens only
#    - Avoid timestamps in names (they'll expire)
#
# 2. REGIONS:
#    - Choose regions close to your users for lower latency
#    - Not all services are available in all regions
#    - Cloud Functions location must differ from storage bucket location
#
# 3. SECURITY:
#    - Keep this file in .gitignore (don't commit secrets)
#    - Use a separate bucket for production configurations
#    - Enable uniform bucket-level access for better security
#
# 4. COST OPTIMIZATION:
#    - Adjust function_max_instances_count based on expected load
#    - Use appropriate memory sizes (128MB sufficient for simple operations)
#    - Enable CDN caching to reduce origin server load
#
# 5. BEFORE DEPLOYING:
#    - Ensure GCP Project ID exists and is active
#    - Verify you have necessary IAM permissions
#    - Run: terraform plan (to review changes)
#    - Run: terraform apply (to deploy)
